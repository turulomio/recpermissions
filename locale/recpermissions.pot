msgid "DESCRIPTION"

msgid "Remove innecesary files or directories with a date and time pattern in the current directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "This app has the following mandatory parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create two directories called 'example' and 'example_directories' in the current working directory and fill it with example files with date and time patterns."
msgstr ""

msgid "Makes a simulation selecting which files will be deleted when --remove parameter is used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deletes files. Be careful, This can't be unmade. Use --pretend before."
msgstr ""

msgid "With --pretend and --remove you can use this parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sets the date and time pattern to search in the current directory filenames. It uses python strftime function format."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't continue, there are different filename roots with date and time patterns:"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't continue, there are files and directories with date and time patterns in the current path"

msgid "We are going to create an example directory to learn how to use it"
msgstr ""

msgid "We are going to see the 10 last files of directory 'toomanyfiles_examples/files'"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can see files with temporal pattern 'YYYYmmdd HHMM' with a day variation"
msgstr ""

msgid "We use to find this kind of files in automatic backups, logs, ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "If we want to save our disk space and we want to keep some of them, we can use TooManyFiles program"
msgstr ""

msgid "So, We want to keep the last 5 files because they are too recent."
msgstr ""

msgid "We want to keep the first file of each month from the rest of the files until a max number the files of 15."
msgstr ""

msgid "We make a simulation with --pretend"
msgstr ""

msgid "We analyze the result with the output.."
msgstr ""

msgid "We like the result, so we can delete files replacing --pretend by --remove. Selected files will be removed permanently"
msgstr ""

msgid "We list the files remaining"
